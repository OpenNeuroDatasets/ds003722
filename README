This data set consists of electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 10 healthy subjects of a study published here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402030270X.
The participants had no previous BCI experience. The BCI protocol consisted of two conditions, namely the kinesthetic imagination of grasping movement of the dominant hand and rest/idle condition.
Five protocol runs were asked to be performed by the user. The first run, called RUN0, involved real grasping movement in order to better explain the protocol and to help the subject to focus on the sensation of making the movement. The rest of the runs (RUN1-RUN4) were equal, consisting of MI vs.Rest conditions.
